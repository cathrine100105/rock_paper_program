This Rock–Paper–Scissors program begins by importing the Scanner and Random classes so the user can input their move and the computer can generate a random choice. Inside the main method, a Scanner object is created to read user input, and a Random object is created to generate computer moves. An array named choices stores the three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors. The program uses variables to hold the player’s choice, the computer’s choice, and a flag (playAgain) that controls whether the game should continue. The entire game runs inside a do-while loop so the user can play multiple rounds. In each round, the player is asked to enter their move, and the input is converted to lowercase to avoid case-sensitivity issues. The program checks whether the user's input is valid; if not, it displays an error message. The computer’s move is selected by generating a random number from 0 to 2, which corresponds to rock, paper, or scissors in the choices array. After both choices are ready, the program compares them. If both moves are the same, the round is a tie. Otherwise, the program checks all the winning conditions for the player: rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beats paper. If any of these conditions are true, the player wins; otherwise, the player loses. After printing the result, the program asks whether the user wants to play again. If the user types "yes", the loop continues; if they type "no", the game ends. When the game is finished, a “Thanks for playing” message appears, and the Scanner object is closed. Overall, this program demonstrates how to use loops, conditions, user input, random number generation, and game logic in a simple interactive Java application.
